\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
This document is written for the course 2015-T-514-VEFT at Reykjavik University, fall 2015. In this document we give introduction to MongoDB\footnote{\url{https://www.mongodb.org/}} and how to communicate with it from NodeJS.

This document is not intended to be a complete guide of MongoDB. There are other books that cover that. This is a tutorial-based introduction for students taking their first steps with MongoDB.

We recommend reading this document if you have never heard or used MongoDB before.

This document is not under any license and can be altered or distributed at will.

After reading this document, we recommend students to read the on-line documentations at MongoDB's website\footnote{\url{https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/}}. It is both comprehensive and well written and describes the database in great depth.
