# OData

OData or Open Data Protocol is a protocol build on HTTP which enables clients to access data in a uniform manner using URLs. As the name implies, the OData services exposes the data to clients, that is, it enables client to CRUD data models through http messages.

OData is a protocol which is platform-independent, and can also be implemented in any server-side framework. It describes a uniform way to access data. A given webservice may or may not implement the OData protocol, either partially or fully.

The full documentation for the OData protocol can be found [here](http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata/v4.0/odata-v4.0-part1-protocol.html)

The OData protocol includes many features but the purpose of this material is only to give the reader an introduction on the topic and familiarize him/her with some of the features.

##Querying Data

OData supports various types of query options. These query options are defined by using query string parameters in HTTP.
Some of them are: 

* $search
  * This query option restricts the result to a maching expression. For example:
    Return all the products that match the string "smuuu"
    http://.../odata/Products?$search="smuuu"

* $filter
  * This query option filters the result based on a boolean condition. For example:
    Return all products with a price less than 10
    http://.../odata/Products?$filter=Price lt 10.00

* $count
  *  This query option returns the total count of items with the result. For example:
     Return all products and total count
     http://.../odata/Products?$count=true

* $orderby
  * This query option orders the result on the given criteria. For example:
    Return all products ordered by category in ascending order
    http://../odata/Products?$orderby=Category asc

* $skip
  * This query option skips the first n results. For example:
    Skip the first 5 products
    http://../odata/Products?$skip=5

* $top
  * This query option returns only the first n results. For example:
    Return the top 3 product
    http://../odata/Products?$top=3

* $expand
  * This query option expands related entities inline. For example: 
    If you have both products and categories and you wish to expand the products for each category
    http://../odata/Categories?$expand=Products

* $select
  * This query option selects the properties in the result. For example:
    Return all products price only
    http://../odata/Products?$select=Price 

* $format
 * This query option specifies the format of the result. For example:
   Return all products result as json
   http://../odata/Products?$format=json

##OData and .NET

Web API supports the creation of an OData service. It is important to note that some of the features that the OData protocol specifies are not supported by the framework.

This tutorial from asp.net covers how to [create an OData v4 Endpoint Using ASP.NET Web API 2.2](http://www.asp.net/web-api/overview/odata-support-in-aspnet-web-api/odata-v4/create-an-odata-v4-endpoint)

Note that the implementation described in the article has a certain design flaw: it exposes the entity objects directly from the API. That design may make sense under some circumstances, but certainly not all. We might therefore resort to implement OData behaviour in a more explicit way, i.e. with less support from built-in libraries.
