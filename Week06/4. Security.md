# Security

Security in the development of Web APIs is no different from other areas of computing: we are dealing with messages between two parties (let us call them Alice and Bob), and a third party (call her Eve) which wants to either know what Alice and Bob are talking about, or wants to impersonate either Alice or Bob and trick them to do something. However, in this case, either Alice or Bob is a Web API, and the other is a client (carbon-based or silicon-based).

The first thing to consider is: can Eve intercept messages between Alice (the client) and Bob (the API)? If the communication between the two of them takes place over HTTP, then that means that all communications are insecure by default, and a simple network sniffing will suffice for Eve to inspect all the communications between Alice and Bob.

It is therefore the first rule of web development (aside from the rule which says that you don't talk about web development) that if the communications between Alice and Bob are not meant for Eve to see, then they must take place over HTTPS. This is expecially true for requests where Alice is sending Bob her username/password combo.

APIs which deal with any sensitive data should therefore always use HTTPS, and should reject requests coming in over HTTP.

## Common vulnerabilities

Even if Alice and Bob use HTTPS for their communications, there are still several common security vulnerabilities which could compromise their interactions. The ones we will cover are:

* SQL Injection
* Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF, also called See-surf)

We will also take a quick look at CAPTCHA as a security measure.

## SQL injection

SQL injection has been the most common security issue in web applications for a long time.

In short, if our application contains code which uses input from users/clients directly when issuing SQL commands, then our app is vulnerable. However, if we use EntityFramework to handle SQL commands, then our app should be safe.

This is a very handy guide of the then most critical (and common) web application
security risks. So it is very handy to read it and keep it around for reference.
