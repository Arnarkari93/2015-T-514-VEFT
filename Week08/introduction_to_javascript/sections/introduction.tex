\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
This document is written for the course 2015-T-514-VEF at Reykjavik University, fall 2015. We give a drive-by introduction to the JavaScript programming language and how to set up development environment for writing JavaScript code. It is not our intention to make this guide a complete reference for the language or as a replacement for other text in the course. We look at this is a introduction level tutorial for beginners in JavaScript.

Note that we only cover parts of the language which we find relevant for this course. We intentionally leave out important aspects of the language, such as closures and prototypes to name a few. In section~\ref{sec:reading_material} we give a list of material which is good to look at after reading this document. We encourage interested students to check them out.
